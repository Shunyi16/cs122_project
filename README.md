# Project Outline/Plan:
## Interface Plan:
The interface will include two windows, which are for collecting data and analyzing data. The program allows users to interact through buttons to collect, update, and analyze data, which are the opening job positions in the field of software development, and then extract the results in the form of charts. Users can choose the time or type of positions they want to collect data from the collecting window. Meanwhile, users can select the number of companies to display in the chart from the analyzing window.

## Data Collection and Storage Plan (written by Author #1) (Shunyi, store data in spreadsheet, data collection from LinkedIn, handshake, etc)

## Data Analysis and Visualization Plan:
The analysis results will be displayed as a line graph. The x-axis is the company's name, and the y-axis is the number of job positions those companies are opening. The initial idea is that the ten companies that have the most opening positions will be chosen to display by default. Additional functions include selecting the number of companies depicted or a specific position.
